# dylanmodesitt
This is the code I made for <a href="http://www.dylanmodesitt.com">dylanmodesitt.com</a>. The site has gone through many iterations. Now, in 2016, it uses <a href="https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js">
FullPage.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/codrops/Blueprint-QuotesRotator"> A quote rotator </a>, and a bunch of small custom things.
