				     I submitted a Privacy Act request on myself for reasons undisclosed as of now. Here it is in the full text with minor redactions for privacy:
				     </p>
				     <p>
				     <br>
					Dear National Security Agency, 
						</p>
				     	<p>
					     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Dylan Carter Modesitt. I was born ██████████████████████████ and currently reside in █████████████ █████████████ ██████████████████████████ ██████████████████████████ 
					     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Privacy Act of 1974 that establishes controls over “what personal information is collected, maintained, used and disseminated by agencies in the executive branch of the Federal government,” I request all information collected in the form of content and metadata under any and all programs conducted by the National Security Agency and the Central Security Service agency of the United States of America. 
					     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Privacy Act only applies to records that are located in a “system of records.” As defined in the Privacy Act, a system of records is “a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.” I request under this act - and under any acts aware of by this agency that entitle citizens of the United States to government information - that any and all data collection retrievable by any identifiable characteristics of my person that include but are not limited to: name, birthdate, email addresses, telephone numbers, account information, banking information, relative information, employment information, academic information, and all other information deemed personally identifiable be released to me and returned to the address of shipment in full disclosure. 
					     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ██████████████████████████ ██████████████████████████ ██████████████████████████ ██████████████████████████ ██████████████████████████ ██████████████████████████ I have never engaged in any behaviors that I was not constitutionally right to do so and thus deem any personal collection of my information in any form that is retrievable a violation of the 4th amendment to the United States Constitution that guarantees “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”
					     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I request all information, regardless of its storage location, difficulty to obtain, or program(s) and legislation, including the patriot act, that the data is collected under, that is accessible to the National Security Agency and the Central Security Service agency. This includes but again is not limited to: Information regarding personal location, information regarding the interaction with other United States citizens in personal and over networks such as the Internet, any activities on the Internet, Email content, sender, receiver, and timing addressed to my personal addresses, mail received by public or private delivery systems, cellular phone content, sender, recipient, and or timing under any private or public agencies. 
					     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, I request that this request not add to details of my person to available systems of records that would be in violation of the required conduct of these requests. Finally, I request that these records be returned to me in a timely manner as described by the Privacy Act. Thank you for the service you do in defending the nation against threats of all kind, the citizens are in debt for the safety you this agency provides; I merely request my personal information of which is not a threat to national security or the sanctity of any Americans.
